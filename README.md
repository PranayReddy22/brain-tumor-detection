# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection and Classification Using Deep Learning

This project applies deep learning techniques to classify brain MRI scans into four categories: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary Tumor**, and **No Tumor**. Early and accurate detection is critical for improving patient outcomes, and this model contributes to the growing field of AI-driven medical diagnostics.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

| Model                          | Test Accuracy |
|--------------------------------|----------------|
| EfficientNetB3                 | **96.64%**     |
| MobileNetV2                    | 92.57%         |
| VGG16                          | 95.48%         |
| ResNet50                       | 94.12%         |
| VGG16 + Extra Conv Layer       | 96.89%         |
| ResNet50 + Extra Conv Layer    | 96.08%         |

- EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest accuracy with balanced speed
- MobileNetV2 was the fastest but slightly less accurate
- Adding a convolutional layer improved both VGG and ResNet performance by ~2%
